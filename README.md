Online Sales Tracker

Project Overview:
This project involved analyzing sales data for various products (A, B, C, D, E) across different sales channels (Amazon, Website, Big Basket, Flipkart, ShopClues) during October 2017. The objective was to assess product performance, sales channel effectiveness, and derive actionable insights using Microsoft Excel.

Data Analysis and Formulas Used:
The analysis utilized several Excel functions and formulas:
1. Profit Calculation: Profit was calculated using the formula `Profit = Sell Price - Cost Price`.
2. Margin Calculation: Margin was determined using `Margin = (Profit / Sell Price)  100`.
3. Net Income Calculation: Net Income per transaction was computed as `Net Income = Profit  Quantity`.
4. Revenue Calculation: Revenue generated per transaction was derived from `Revenue = Sell Price  Quantity`.
5. Lookup Formulas: Used to retrieve Cost Price and Sell Price based on Product and Sales Channel.

Key Metrics and Insights:
1. Product Performance:
   - Product A: Primarily sold on Amazon and Website, with significant contributions from Big Basket.
